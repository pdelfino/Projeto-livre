Idea
===

In 2013, many protests occured in Brazil. These events are known as
 _2013 Confederations Cup riots_, _Brazilian Sprint_ and _June Journeys_.

During this period, many protestants were being illegaly arrested. Some popular attorneys
were doing preventive _Habeas Corpus_ manually on the streets.

That's when I had a sudden insight. What if people could automatically
do a preventive _Habeas Corpus_ automatically through a Facebook extension?

That would be more efficient. It would protect more people and it would be legal.
That's what we did!

Failed
===
This project was build in 2014, before the World Cup. By that time, we thought
that in 2014 protests like the ones in 2013 would happen again. However, they didn't happen.
The Facebook app only got 300 likes and was used just 30 times.

I think this was a good idea. But it lost the right _timing_.

Authorship
===

Despite having the idea of the project, I am not the responsible for writting 
this code. By that time, I was just a hobbyist and knew very little about programming.

However, I was the leader of the  team responsible for building this project.
The team had people with design, programming and law skills.
I was responsible for submiting the code for the contest
_Vai Mudar na Copa_ via Github. The code remained here.

The main author of this code was Thiago Cavalcante. His email is: ```thicosc at gmail dot com```.

 √çtalo Ferreira dos Santos was
resposible for the design, his email is ```oi at italoferreira dot com dot br``` 

The other members contributed to the legal aspects: 

+ Fernanda Almeida Fernandes de Oliveira ```fernandaafoliveira at gmail dot com```
+ Ricardo Carrion ```rcarrionalves at gmail dot com```; and,
+ Luan Camargo ```luan_mateus_camargo at hotmail dot com```.

Requirements
===

To run this code you need at least Android 2.2.
Is is also necessary to allow installs from unkown fonts.
